This repository contains the codes for the paper "Tumor Phylogeny Topology Inference via Deep Learning". There is a final version of the code in [this](https://github.com/algo-cancer/PhyloM) link with instructions. I spent some time to re-implement the Tensorflow code in Keras for the Noise Elimination problem, but in the final evaluations before publishing the paper I realized it needs some more work. Some weights were not being trained. Since I was leaving my position at NIH I didn't get to work on it. I recommend using the Tensorflow implementation.
